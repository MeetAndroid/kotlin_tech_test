# kotlin_tech_test
This test is based on the following kata: http://codekata.com/kata/kata04-data-munging/

## Instructions
1. Clone this repository
2. Create a branch for your work named `firstname_lastname` (using your own first and last name)
3. Add four commits
    - The first commit should include a basic project skeleton with tests (overwrite the readme to give instructions on how to run the tests)
    - The second commit should provide a solution to the first part of the problem
    - The third commit should provide a solution to the second part of the problem
    - The fourth commit should provide a solution to the third part of the problem.

## Problem
### Part one
Write a function that loads the file `weather.dat` and returns the day (first column) that had the smallest difference between min and max temp (second and third columns).  Do not modify the data file.  Write a test that checks your function works.

### Part two
Write a function that loads the file `football.dat` and returns the name of the team that had the smallest difference between column F and column A (goals scored "for" and "against"). Do not modify the data file.  Write a test that checks your function works.

### Part three
As a final change refactor your solutions to part one and two to remove as much duplication as possible. Feel free to add comments to the readme to outline what considerations were made as part of this process as well as any other thoughts (What made this difficult, what made it easy, how will this affect maintenance, etc.)
